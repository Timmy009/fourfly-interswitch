## Introduction

Welcome to the **Airline Reservation System** project developed by **Group Four**. This system is meticulously crafted to efficiently manage flight bookings, passenger details, and flight schedules for **FourFly Airways**. With a user-friendly interface and robust backend functionalities, our system streamlines the process of flight reservation and enhances the overall experience for both passengers and administrators.

## Project Overview

In response to the global demand for seamless air travel experiences, **FourFly Airways** endeavors to extend its services across multiple destinations worldwide. To facilitate this expansion and meet the evolving needs of the aviation industry, our team has developed an advanced **Airline Reservation System** with the following key features:

- **Comprehensive Flight Booking and Management**: Our system provides a centralized platform for managing flight schedules, seat availability, and passenger bookings, ensuring efficient operations and optimal customer satisfaction.
  
- **Secure User Registration and Login Functionalities**: Passengers can register and login securely to access personalized booking experiences, while administrators have dedicated access for managing system operations and data.

- **Customized User Categories**: Passengers are categorized into *Frequent* and *Gold* tiers based on their booking history, with each tier offering exclusive discounts and privileges to enhance customer loyalty.

- **Intuitive Seat Selection Mechanism**: Our system features an intuitive interface for seat selection, allowing passengers to choose their preferred seats with ease and convenience.

- **Support for Multiple Aircraft Types**: With support for various aircraft types and configurations, our system caters to diverse travel requirements and seating capacities.

- **Hierarchical Location Structure**: A hierarchical location structure for airports and cities facilitates seamless expansion to new destinations, enabling efficient management of flight routes and operational logistics.

- **Dynamic Reporting Functionalities**: Administrators have access to comprehensive reporting functionalities, enabling insightful analysis of passenger data, booking trends, and revenue streams for informed decision-making.

## Database Design

At the core of our system lies a meticulously designed database architecture that encapsulates all essential entities and relationships. Leveraging industry best practices, our database ensures data consistency, integrity, and performance through the strategic implementation of primary keys, foreign keys, stored procedures, functions, and triggers. Additionally, efficient indexing techniques are employed to optimize query performance and enhance overall system responsiveness.

## Functionality

### User Registration and Login

Our system offers a seamless user registration process, allowing passengers to create accounts and access a personalized booking experience. Registered users are categorized into *Frequent* and *Gold* tiers based on their booking history, entitling them to exclusive discounts and privileges.

### Flight Booking

Passengers can effortlessly browse through the comprehensive flight schedule and select their preferred itinerary. With an intuitive seat selection interface, users can choose their seats with ease, ensuring a hassle-free booking process. Our system meticulously manages seat availability and prevents overbooking, guaranteeing a smooth boarding experience for all passengers.

### Ticket Booking

Upon selecting their desired flight, passengers proceed to the ticket booking stage, where they finalize their reservation and make payment through our secure external payment gateway. Upon successful booking, a digital ticket is promptly issued to the passenger, containing all relevant travel details. Ticket prices are dynamically calculated based on the traveler class, ensuring fair pricing for all passengers.

### Hierarchical Location Structure

Our system incorporates a hierarchical location structure for airports and cities, facilitating seamless expansion to new destinations. Each airport is assigned a universally recognized airport code, and its corresponding city information is meticulously stored within the system. This hierarchical approach enables efficient management of flight routes and enhances the overall scalability of the system.

## Reports

Our system empowers administrators with comprehensive reporting functionalities, enabling them to gain valuable insights into passenger demographics, booking trends, and revenue streams. Some of the key reports generated by our system include:

- **Passenger Demographics Breakdown**: Analyze passenger demographics for specific flights, categorized by age groups, to better understand customer preferences and behavior patterns.

- **Destination Traffic Analysis**: Gain insights into passenger traffic to a given destination within a specified timeframe, facilitating strategic route planning and marketing initiatives.

- **Booking Statistics**: Track booking statistics for each passenger category within a designated date range to assess the effectiveness of promotional campaigns and loyalty programs.

- **Historical Flight Data**: Access historical flight data, including departure states and passenger counts, for specific origin-destination pairs, to identify trends and optimize operational efficiencies.

- **Revenue Analysis**: Evaluate total revenue generated by each aircraft type, facilitating strategic decision-making and resource allocation to maximize profitability.
